1 - delete and update not work
- DELETE :
I clicked on the remove button and it does not work
, i saw on my browser that request delete has been send , but i don't see DELETE sql remove , so i supposed that it was a misconfiguration somewhere.
And then i watched the class , service and then repo , and i found that 'readonly" true .

- UPDATE :
Writing a comment , put call has been call.
I check the controller and see that there is no code in the endpoint
so i create a method in the service that call save method.
But i've an error that blocked me a little bit :
org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing:

The problem was that some object were returned without ID , so it tried to recreate them in the database.
I had 2 possibilites : - Update my front to get those id and then return them to the backend again
                       - update my method to get all the event data before processing update

I choosed to update my backend method to get all data and Ids it needs ,
 because we know that front is full tested and has not to be modified


So the strategy I used was the following one :
 - reload with the ID the Event from database
 - and merge data that we want to update

Then it was OK :) !

I Wrote unit test for all existing method to valid common usecase, and now i can implements new methods
