## FIX : delete and update not working ##
# DELETE :

I clicked on the remove button and it does not work
, i saw on my browser that request delete has been send , but i don't see DELETE sql remove , so i supposed that it was a misconfiguration somewhere.
And then i watched the class , service and then repo , and i found that 'readonly" true .

# UPDATE :

Writing a comment , put call has been call.
I check the controller and see that there is no code in the endpoint
so i create a method in the service that call save method.
But I've an error that blocked me a little bit :
org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing:

The problem was that some object were returned without ID , so it tried to recreate them in the database.
I had 2 possibilites : - Update my front to get those id and then return them to the backend again
                       - update my method to get all the event data before processing update

I choosed to update my backend method to get all data and Ids it needs ,
 because we know that front is full tested and has not to be modified


So the strategy I used was the following one :
 - reload with the ID the Event from database
 - and merge data that we want to update

Then it was OK :) !

## BEFORE Implementings new functionality ##

I Wrote integration test for all existing method to valid common usecase, and now i can implements new methods
I also wrote missing unit test before starting
 to implements search with filter method to do it as TDD method


## ADDING NEW FUNCTIONALITY ##

Then I start to implements new methods using TDD.
I start my test (he return me not ok)
I implements the methods logic in the service

Then my unit test was OK
Then I wrote integration test for this functionnality.

I saw that there was no details about the search criteria ,
I made a not "case sensitive" search that is more user-friendly and common use case.

## EDITING NEW FUNCTIONALITY ##
I Write a new unit test in the service who's testing the new feature
The test is false

- I'm adding new function in the service
- This second function is called in the controller
because i want to split this from the search criteria service function.

Test passed
I also add integration test
